In this project suggested to me by Codecademy throughout my Back-End Engineering career path,
I will use Envelope Budgeting to build a system and an app for anyone to manage their personal finances.


My personal focus for this part of the project, is the backend, the database and the general functionality. 
With this in mind, I build this project using Express.js for the bakend, PostgreSQL for the db, and Vanilla Javascript for the front-end.
I plan to add some React, for the front end, and some Mocha, for automatic testing.
